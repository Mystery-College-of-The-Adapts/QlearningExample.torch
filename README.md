# TorchQLearning

Torch plays catch! Based on Eder Santanas' [implementation](https://gist.github.com/EderSantana/c7222daa328f0e885093) in keras. Highly recommend reading his informative and easy to follow blog post [here](https://edersantana.github.io/articles/keras_rl/).

Agent has to catch the fruit before it falls to the ground. Agent wins if he succeeds to catch the fruit, loses if he fails.

Currently no GUI to show the final trained model's performance, am considering a way to do this.
