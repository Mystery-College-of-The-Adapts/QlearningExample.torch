(Not the best model in the world)

Torch plays catch! Based on Eder Santanas' [implementation](https://gist.github.com/EderSantana/c7222daa328f0e885093) in keras. Highly recommend reading his informative and easy to follow blog post [here](https://edersantana.github.io/articles/keras_rl/).

Agent has to catch the fruit before it falls to the ground. Agent wins if he succeeds to catch the fruit, loses if he fails.

Visualization implemented in [itorch](https://github.com/facebook/iTorch). Click [here](https://github.com/facebook/iTorch#requirements) for install instructions.

To run, type into terminal:

```
itorch notebook
```

And navigate to the TorchPlaysCatch.pynb. Run the kernel (you must've installed the above dependencies).
